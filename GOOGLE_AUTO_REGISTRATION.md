# Google Auto-Registration Feature

## Overview
Users can now automatically register and log in using their Google account. If a user doesn't exist in the database, they will be automatically created with their Google profile information.

## How It Works

### 1. User Flow
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth flow completes
3. Backend checks if user exists by email
4. If user doesn't exist:
   - Creates new user account automatically
   - Uses Google profile data (name, email, picture)
   - Sets default values for required fields
   - Marks email as verified (since Google verified it)
5. User is logged in and redirected to appropriate dashboard

### 2. Auto-Registration Details

#### Data Used from Google:
- **First Name**: `given_name` from Google profile
- **Last Name**: `family_name` from Google profile  
- **Email**: Verified email from Google
- **Profile Picture**: `picture` URL from Google
- **Username**: Generated from email (e.g., `john.doe` from `john.doe@gmail.com`)

#### Default Values for Required Fields:
- **Phone**: `+1000000000` (placeholder)
- **Address**: `Not provided`
- **City**: `Not provided`
- **State**: `Not provided`
- **Postal Code**: `00000`
- **Country**: `Not provided`
- **User Type**: `customer`
- **Password**: Random secure string (not used since they use Google)
- **Email Verified**: `true` (Google verified)
- **Account Status**: `active`

### 3. Username Generation
- Uses email prefix (before @) as base username
- If username exists, appends number (e.g., `john.doe1`, `john.doe2`)
- Ensures unique usernames in database

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`server/lakbay-backend/src/services/authService.js`)
- Modified `googleLogin` function to auto-register users
- Added `isNewUser` flag in response
- Added security logging for auto-registrations
- Handles username uniqueness

### Frontend Changes (`lakbay/src/hooks/auth/useAuth.ts`)
- Updated to handle `isNewUser` flag
- Added logging for new user registrations

### Frontend Changes (`lakbay/src/hooks/login/useLoginForm.ts`)
- Added welcome message for new users
- Improved error handling

## Security Considerations

1. **Email Verification**: Google-verified emails are automatically marked as verified
2. **Password Security**: Random passwords are generated (not used for login)
3. **Audit Logging**: All auto-registrations are logged for security
4. **Account Status**: New accounts are set to active by default

## User Experience

### For New Users:
- Seamless registration and login in one step
- No need to fill out registration forms
- Immediate access to the application
- Welcome message in console (can be enhanced with UI notifications)

### For Existing Users:
- Normal Google login flow
- No changes to existing functionality

## Testing

To test the auto-registration:

1. Use a Google account that doesn't exist in your database
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Complete Google OAuth flow
4. User should be automatically created and logged in
5. Check database for new user record
6. Check logs for auto-registration event

## Future Enhancements

1. **Profile Completion Prompt**: Ask new users to complete missing profile information
2. **Welcome Onboarding**: Show guided tour for new users
3. **Phone Number Collection**: Optional step to collect real phone number
4. **Address Collection**: Optional step to collect real address
5. **UI Notifications**: Show toast/alert for successful auto-registration

## Database Impact

- New users will have placeholder data in required fields
- Consider making some fields optional in future schema updates
- Monitor for users with placeholder data who might need profile completion

## Error Handling

- If username generation fails, uses email as fallback
- If user creation fails, returns appropriate error
- All errors are logged for debugging
- Frontend handles both success and error cases gracefully
